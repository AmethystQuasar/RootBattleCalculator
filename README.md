# RootBattleCalculator

RootBattleCalculator is a simple app for determining the likelihoods of relevant outcomes for battles in the board game Root by designer Cole Wehrle.
The primary purpose of the app is to help retrospectively analyze critical endgame moments, but it can also be used as a training tool.
The app is not meant to be used during games as guesstimating success probability is as much part of the game as the battles themselves.

The app can currently calculate the likelihoods for the following battle outcomes:
- Eliminating all (or all reported) pieces from one enemy faction in a clearing
- Gaining control of a clearing
- Having your opponent lose control of the clearing
- Being able to build

All of the above also take into account how many battle actions you can take. Stringing together fights between many opponents is easy through basic 
probability (multiply the outcomes together).

The app is in its first form so fixes and additions will be introduced as needed.
